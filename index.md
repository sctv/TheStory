### Chapter 1: Bring the Timetable and Your House Keys  
_The field didn’t ask for paperwork._  

A 44-year-old man woke up among beans, five miles from Alnwick, empty of name, reason, and orientation. He’d entered with bags and a bike; he left with only a wallet. Every clock blinked a lie—2009, 2023, 1964—and Cramlington’s fluorescent glare was a sermon he couldn’t hear. They flinched. They discharged him before they could label him well.

---

### Chapter 2: Don’t Forget Your Name or Where You Live  
_Survival doesn’t come with a postcode._  

He drank three litres of water in twenty-five minutes because he didn’t believe he had a stomach. Nurses watched as he filled three urinal pans—a baptism of proof. He dismantled their bathroom lights, traced power into the sink, and refused the glare. They called him difficult; he called it mercy.

---

### Chapter 3: Round and Round, Up and Down  
_Every town has its loops. Northumberland’s are sacred._  

They circled him in A&E: paperwork, walls, procedures that made no sense. His mind traced deer trails, barnacle patterns, bean-field spirals. Every suggestion—ground-sitting, silent beats, unplugged clocks—fell on deaf ears. So he built his own liturgy from chaos.

---

### Chapter 4: Don’t the Sun Look Good Today?  
_Except when the light burns memory._  

That brightness was betrayal. He sat cross-legged on the linoleum, back against the wall—anchored to shadow. The system saw optics; he saw sunlight refracted through smash-blue ink on skin. He needed dullness to remember shape.

---

### Chapter 5: Watch the Butcher Shine His Knives  
_Institutional precision, detached from soul._  

They sliced his case into labels: “risk,” “non-compliant,” “treated.” He watched them sharpen protocols like scalpels. He fought back with silence, with refusal to be cut into their chart.

---

### Chapter 6: This Town Is Full of Battered Wives  
_Hidden violence. Unseen wounds._  

Under that fluorescent ceiling, lives cracked open daily. His own fractures felt intimate—a communion of broken souls. He learned that suffering often wears a polite face.

---

### Chapter 7: Why Don’t You Get to Bed Like Everybody Else?  
_Ground-rituals. Sacred resistance._  

They told him chairs were safer. He said the floor had gravity, truth, roots. Every time they asked him to conform, he knelt on linoleum like a prayer. That was his protest: slow, silent, ancestral.

---

### Chapter 8: I Ride Your River Under the Bridge  
_Flow beneath surfaces._  

The ward’s corridors were rivers of protocol. He swam beneath them—out of sight, under expectation. His currents carried him through fractured time.

---

### Chapter 9: I Take Your Boat Out to the Reach  
_Escape. Sonic lifelines._  

His only compass was music. Field Music’s fractured pop stitched his mind back together. With battered headphones and muddy trainers, he voyaged beyond containment.

---

### Chapter 10: I Love That Engine Roar  
_Rhythm as medicine._  

Every syncopated beat was prayer for a mind unstrung. Engine roars, drum hits, offset vocals—they were the architecture for a rebuilt psyche.

---

### Chapter 11: But I Still Don’t Know What I’m Here For  
_Existential drift. Ink-stained question._  

He pawned his wedding ring for eighty pounds. He did all the dumb things. Every mistake carried melody; every regret hummed with strange grace. He wrote to find his answer.

---

### Chapter 12: They Shut It Down  
_Containment over care._  

They flinched, labelled, ejected him. Not because he was well, but because he was uncontainable. In that expulsion, he found his blueprint for autonomy—and the story he was born to tell.
